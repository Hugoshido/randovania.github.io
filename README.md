# Randovania

With Randovania, each Metroid Prime 2: Echoes playthrough shuffles the location of all items in the game.
You could find the Light Beam right off the start, or the Bombs deep inside Sanctuary Fortress.

## Credits

Many thanks to [Claris](https://www.twitch.tv/claris) for
making the Echoes Randomizer and both collecting and providing this
incredible set of data which powers Randovania.

Claris also made the included [Menu Mod](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhqqafaxfo3l4vn/Echoes%20Menu.7z),
a tool for practicing Echoes. For more information, see the
[Menu Mod README](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yhqqafaxfo3l4vn/Echoes%20Menu.7z?file_subpath=%2FEchoes+Menu%2Freadme.txt).

Also thanks to [Dyceron](https://www.twitch.tv/dyceron) for motivation and testing.
